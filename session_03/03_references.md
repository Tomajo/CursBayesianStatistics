Reading material
================

* [A Bayesian interpretation of ridge regression penalization](http://www.unicog.org/pmwiki/uploads/Main/PresentationMM_02_10.pdf); perhaps not the best introduction to the link between Bayesian statistics and regularization techniques in the non-Bayesian world. The same principles apply to other kind of regularizations (lasso, etc.)
* [Fitting mixed models with lmer](http://lme4.r-forge.r-project.org/book/Ch4.pdf). Package `lmer`, among others, allow a simpler fitting of mixed models in R without the _full Bayesian_ approach. Normally, these packages have restrictions on the nature of the priors you can use, the degree of regularization applied, etc.
* [One way ANOVA (with random effects) via Stan](http://www.maths.bath.ac.uk/~jjf23/stan/oneway.html)
